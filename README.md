# Action_Recognition
This project involves "Human Action Recognition" using "ResNet50" for spatial feature extraction and "LSTM" for sequence learning. It classifies actions like Basketball, Diving, Horse Racing, Jump Rope, and Volleyball Spiking from videos. The model is trained to detect actions efficiently and can be reused for video-based activity recognition.
